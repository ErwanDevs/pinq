# pinq
A Python library trying to reproduce C# linq introduced with .Net 6 (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=net-6.0). It provides an Enumerable class extending python Iterator.
Some methods may not be transferable to Python, seeing how there's no method overloading, some choices might be made.

## How do I use it?
Like you normally would use linq (hopefully). Just import it and select everything.

## Why?
As an exercise mostly, I like how Python manages list so I want to learn more about it and it seemed like an interesting project.
