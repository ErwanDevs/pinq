# pinq
A Python library trying to reproduce C# linq. It provides extension methods for the iterable type.

## How do I use it?
Like you normally would use linq (hopefully). Just import it and select everything.

## Why?
As an exercise mostly, I like how Python manages list so I want to learn more about it and it seemed like an interesting project.
